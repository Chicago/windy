  "description" : "The Tax Increment Financing (TIF) Projection Report is a three-year planning document used to evaluate resources and project balances to determine how much funding has been committed and how much funding is available for potential projects in each of the City’s TIF districts. \r\n\r\nThis report is updated with the latest available information and does not represent a final accounting of funds in any TIF district. Annual audited financial reports are found on the City’s website and are published once a year to reflect the balances and expenditures in each TIF fund. \r\n\r\nThe TIF Projection Report provides estimates of TIF revenue and expenditures in each TIF district in the City of Chicago over a three-year period.\r\n\r\nFunding sources include:\r\n\r\nUnallocated Funds: Available funds at the beginning of the current year. This includes incremental property tax revenue from prior years. Revenue collected in the prior year is typically used to fund obligations in the current year. Some portion of prior-year collections may be used to fund obligations in subsequent years.\r\n\r\nUnallocated Bond/Note Proceeds: Available funds remaining from a bond sale or note issued to the City by a bank or other lender. \r\n\r\nEstimated Incremental Property Tax Revenue: Includes projected incremental property tax revenue collections for the current and subsequent two years. Estimates are based on recent equalized assessed values and tax rates and may be adjusted to reflect property tax collection patterns for a particular TIF.\r\n\r\nTransfers include:\r\n\r\nTransfers In: Funds that are transferred into a TIF district for a specific purpose from one or more adjacent TIF districts. \r\n\r\nTransfers Out: Funds that are transferred to one or more adjacent TIF districts for specific purposes.\r\n\r\nCurrent obligations items may include:\r\n\r\nDebt service payments on bonds or notes; payments to private developers pursuant to redevelopment agreements authorized by City Council; costs of public improvements; and costs of capital projects for overlapping taxing districts, such as the Board of Education or the Chicago Park District. The obligations may also include administrative costs that are incurred by the City for the implementation and administration of the Redevelopment Plan associated with each TIF. \r\n\r\nPotential projects include:\r\n\r\nProjects that are currently under consideration and which have not yet received necessary approval(s). In some cases, the dollar amounts listed reflect estimated project costs. As these projects take shape and move through the approval process, they are expected to become an obligation of the TIF.",

  "description" : "The Annual Appropriation Ordinance is the final City operating budget as approved by the City Council. It reflects the City’s operating budget at the beginning of the fiscal year on January 1, 2011.This dataset displays the positions and related salaries detailed in the budget as of January 1. It is extracted from the personnel portion of the Appropriation Ordinance. The dataset presents the position titles (without names) and salaries described in the budget, but does not provide a reflection of the current city workforce with full names and salaries. Disclaimer: the “Total Budgeted Units” column displays either A) the number of employees AND vacancies associated with a given position, or B) the number of budgeted units (ie. hours/months) for that position. “Position Control” determines whether Total Budgeted Units column will count employees and vacancies or hours/months. If a Position Control is 1, then employees and vacancies are displayed; if a Position Control is 0, then the total number of hours/months recorded is displayed. Owner: Budget and Management. Frequency: Data is updated annually. For information on the current city workforce, with names, positions and salaries, visit the \"Current Employee Names, Salaries, and Position Titles\" dataset: http://j.mp/iutKlR.",

  "description" : "The Annual Appropriation Ordinance is the final City operating budget as approved by the City Council. It reflects the City’s operating budget and anticipated grants at the beginning of the fiscal year on January 1, 2011. This dataset displays the positions and related salaries detailed in the budget. The data is extracted directly from the personnel portion of the Appropriation Ordinance. The dataset presents the position titles (without names) and salaries described in the budget, but does not provide a reflection of the current city workforce with full names and salaries. Disclaimer: the “Total Budgeted Units” column displays either A) the number of employees AND vacancies associated with a given position, or B) the number of budgeted units (ie. hours/months) for that position. “Position Control” determines whether Total Budgeted Units column will count employees and vacancies or hours/months, etc. If a Position Control is 1, then employees and vacancies are counted; if a Position Control is 0, then the total number of hours/months, etc. recorded is displayed. Owner: Budget and Management. Frequency: Data is updated annually. For information on the current city workforce, with names, positions and salaries, visit the \"Current Employee Names, Salaries, and Position Titles\" dataset: http://j.mp/iutKlR.",

  "description" : "This dataset reflects reported incidents of crime (with the exception of murders where data exists for each victim) that occurred in the City of Chicago from 2001 to present, minus the most recent seven days. Data is extracted from the Chicago Police Department's CLEAR (Citizen Law Enforcement Analysis and Reporting) system. In order to protect the privacy of crime victims, addresses are shown at the block level only and specific locations are not identified. Should you have questions about this dataset, you may contact the Research & Development Division of the Chicago Police Department at 312.745.6071 or RandD@chicagopolice.org. Disclaimer: These crimes may be based upon preliminary information supplied to the Police Department by the reporting parties that have not been verified. The preliminary crime classifications may be changed at a later date based upon additional investigation and there is always the possibility of mechanical or human error. Therefore, the Chicago Police Department does not guarantee (either expressed or implied) the accuracy, completeness, timeliness, or correct sequencing of the information and the information should not be used for comparison purposes over time. The Chicago Police Department will not be responsible for any error or omission, or for the use of, or the results obtained from the use of this information.

  "description" : "Average Daily Traffic (ADT) counts are analogous to a census count of vehicles on city streets. These counts provide a close approximation to the actual number of vehicles passing through a given location on an average weekday. Since it is not possible to count every vehicle on every city street, sample counts are taken along larger streets to get an estimate of traffic on half-mile or one-mile street segments. ADT counts are used by city planners, transportation engineers, real-estate developers, marketers and many others for myriad planning and operational purposes.\r\nData Owner: Transportation.\r\nTime Period: 2006.\r\nFrequency: A citywide count is taken approximately every 10 years. A limited number of traffic counts will be taken and added to the list periodically.\r\nRelated Applications: Traffic Information Interactive Map (http://webapps.cityofchicago.org/traffic/).",

  "description" : "Average Daily Traffic (ADT) counts are analogous to a census count of vehicles on city streets. These counts provide a close approximation to the actual number of vehicles passing through a given location on an average weekday. Since it is not possible to count every vehicle on every city street, sample counts are taken along larger streets to get an estimate of traffic on half-mile or one-mile street segments. ADT counts are used by city planners, transportation engineers, real-estate developers, marketers and many others for myriad planning and operational purposes.\r\nData Owner: Transportation.\r\nTime Period: 2006.\r\nFrequency: A citywide count is taken approximately every 10 years. A limited number of traffic counts will be taken and added to the list periodically.\r\nRelated Applications: Traffic Information Interactive Map (http://webapps.cityofchicago.org/traffic/).",

The Board has, since 2000, compiled and posted static lists of all lobbyists and their clients online. Data for the 2010 reporting period is limited because previous policy did not require the Board of Ethics to prioritize the reporting of all data available from paper filings. \r\nMoving forward, the Board of Ethics will compile and report more data about lobbyists and their activities, and make that additional information publicly available in machine-readable format. /   \r\nData Owner:  Board of Ethics \r\n[http://j.mp/mbH9BN] /\r\nTime Period: January 1, 2010 to December 31, 2010 /\r\nFrequency:  Data is organized by year and will be updated daily beginning with the 2011 registration period. / \r\nRelated Applications:  Registered Lobbyist List [http://j.mp/l8LwAq]",

These codes are also used to aggregate types of cases for statistical purposes.  In Illinois, the Illinois State Police establish IUCR codes, but the agencies can add codes to suit their individual needs.  The Chicago Police Department currently uses more than 350 IUCR codes to classify criminal offenses, divided into “Index” and “Non-Index” offenses.  Index offenses are the offenses that are collected nation-wide by the Federal Bureaus of Investigation’s Uniform Crime Reports program to document crime trends over time (data released semi-annually), and include murder, criminal sexual assault, robbery, aggravated assault & battery, burglary, theft, motor vehicle theft, and arson.  Non-index offenses are all other types of criminal incidents, including vandalism, weapons violations, public peace violations, etc.",

  "description" : "This dataset reflects reported incidents of crime (with the exception of murders where data exists for each victim) that occurred in the City of Chicago from 2001 to present, minus the most recent seven days. Data is extracted from the Chicago Police Department's CLEAR (Citizen Law Enforcement Analysis and Reporting) system. In order to protect the privacy of crime victims, addresses are shown at the block level only and specific locations are not identified. Should you have questions about this dataset, you may contact the Research & Development Division of the Chicago Police Department at 312.745.6071 or RandD@chicagopolice.org. Disclaimer: These crimes may be based upon preliminary information supplied to the Police Department by the reporting parties that have not been verified. The preliminary crime classifications may be changed at a later date based upon additional investigation and there is always the possibility of mechanical or human error. Therefore, the Chicago Police Department does not guarantee (either expressed or implied) the accuracy, completeness, timeliness, or correct sequencing of the information and the information should not be used for comparison purposes over time. The Chicago Police Department will not be responsible for any error or omission, or for the use of, or the results obtained from the use of this information.
